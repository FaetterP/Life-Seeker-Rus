Ain't you quaint, mate. \.what's got ya so hoppy?
Things ain't like they used to be round here, \.aye? \. Everyones got some new found pep.
Met a bloke who I reckon mucked everything all up for us. \.Yep, \.came in with that same dead stare you got.
Yer a helluva lot cuter though, \.tell ya what.
back in my day there were way more freaks around, \.ya know that? \.seems most the freaks pissed off to the tower.
Only the strongest linger in the processed world now.
LIl Tomo. \.Bug eyed girl.
I'm not bug eyed. | Yes?
aye, \.aye... \.is okay to be a lil borked ya know?
I wanna know, \.what ya wanna see out the world. \. ya feel me?
Many folks meander, \.they ain't even know if they are alive or what they may be lookin' for.
You'd think that would only happen here, \.round the naraka. \.But nah, \.happens on earth too. 
Land of the livin' my ass. \.I know a girl who, \.a special breed of girl many knew about.
Retained her memories, \.and sent us letters. \.man the place sounds like a drag, \.and life is so short!
I want to see a pretty flower. | I want to make lots of friends.
That's freakin lame.
I'm lookin for somethin sick. \.It'll blow your tiny little head off its neck, \.and lucky for you I may even show it to you when I find it!.
there's a mirror around, \.yeah? \. well, \.on rare occasion the mirror opens a portal to the land of the living. 
I wanna go see that place for myself, \.maybe i'll member somethin or another!
......
Aye, \.tomo. \.I'm busy ya see? lil green ate the last of my sweets and im gonna squeeze em out of em!
What ya wanna watch? \.didn't know you were such a freak tomo......
Didn't find the mirror yet, \.don't worry i'm still loookin!
