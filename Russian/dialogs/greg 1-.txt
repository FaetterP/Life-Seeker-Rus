Oh, \.heyo! \.Fine mornin' to ya neighbor.
My fortune cookie said somethin rather profound! \.funny that.
Oh dear, \.yeah it said the ocean yearned for me.
Tell that ocean my wife won't be too pleased! \.bwahahah....
She used to make the greatest sweet corn, \.oh god rest her soul.
Though I don't mind a fine wander through here! \.maybe one day I may even meet her again.
Wouldn't that be grand!
