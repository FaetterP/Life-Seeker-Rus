Ohhh my...... \.darling. \.You reak of muse!
I don't suppose you've been hanging around my sisters, \.have you?
Oh yes, \.I surely smell Hymnia. \.I hope that naive girl is doing well.
Is she pestering you to find things she finds beautiful? \.she tends to fixate on such.
Try not to break her fragile heart, \.kay dear?
If it isn't the cutest dear Tomo! Oh my how I feel so bad for what you must endure.
Speaking to my sisters I mean, \.truly an exhausting task that is.
You see many of us gravitate towards rather.... \.hmmm... \.bland obsessions.
It can be tough to find a purpose in a world that moves as fast as ours, \.don't you agree?
I suppose I rather envy their simplistic nature. \.You seem more complex though, \.I can see it behind those cute eyes.
What could possibly weigh so heavily on your mind, \.Tomo?
I want to see beautiful things. | I want to make friends
Perhaps these matters aren't as simple as they seem and I simply can't begin to understand.
It would seem I too suffer from this lack of empathy epidemic.
I can only hope you find what you seek.
....
Oh, \.Tomo. \.My dear sister came to visit me recently. \.can you believe that? 
Yes, \.I had stood above a great lake. \.somtimes it ripples in mysterious ways that can provide great insight.
She had been watching me from below, \.coincidentally I had decided to loiter where she rests.
It was not my intent to wake her.... \.I promise that.
But I could feel it, \.some of her heavy guilt lifted. \.it was rather comforting.
It was like she knew a great conclusion to her purpose was on the cusp of gracing the coming moments.
Then she emerged from the water, \.for a moment she even smilled. \.I've not seen her do so in many years.
Color me surprised to learn it was her who had constructed the tower! \.I can't say I much understand it though.
it was enjoyable to catch up, \.though I do worry what kind of events will transpire. \.Her drive alludes me.
Perhaps you could learn something from meeting her.
