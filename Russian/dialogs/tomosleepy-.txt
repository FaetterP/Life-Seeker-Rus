I think it's time for rest.....
Tomo, \.Don't you think it's time to get up?
huh... | why are you in my house?
I wanted to see where you live.  \.I have to say, \.It's an interesting little spot.
I can't let you sleep all day! \.there are many wonderful things we may find on our search!
We also can't find a yellow aspodell with our eyes closed, \.of course.
My, Tomo. \.are you always so slow to rise? \.You look.... ragged.
Have you considered stretching, \.or maybe even resting a bit earlier? \.You may not age so gracefully at this rate.
Or your face may get stuck that way, \.then everyone may think you are a grouch.
I have a feeling if I did not wake you, \.you may just sleep forever.
are you not happy to see me on this fine afternoon?
......
I see.... \. well shall we be off?
Next time should I bring you a coffee? \.Or pehaps even a beer? \.My sister had used to use this trick.
Time for rest....
.....
