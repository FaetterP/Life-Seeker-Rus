Oh\. it's you!\. Hi Tomorrow....
Do I know you? | Hi?
Oh,\. Tomo, \. Don't you remember me?\. I'm the cherub you had used to play with!
I thank you for caring for me after my father had vanished..... \. I do wonder where he had gone.
You got rather tall! | How do I grow wings like this?
My wings? \. well,\. one day while rolling about they sort of just popped out!\. maybe you need them shaken out of you!
Oh yes,\. I supposed I am much taller than you now. \. for someone your age I am quite surprised how short you are.!
Oh dear,\. Tomo... Don't look so pensive. 
Maybe you'll grow even more soon! you could be a late bloomer!
Oh, \. Tomo! will you come spend time with me?
yes  | not yet
Oh how wonderful!
I thnk about this city alot.\. I hear there was an effort to stop its expansion at one point,\. but for some reason it seems to have gone neglected.  
For the best,\. I reckon.\. Many of us live here after all.\. I hear stories of people seeking beautiful things only to never return. 
For me,\. I don't think I've ever seen anything I can describe as beautiful so perhaps maybe one day I will leave too.
I do love it here,\. I've my friends after all.\. Like you tomo!\. But..... \.  
I feel as if this city is devoid of wonders I hear in stories, in comparison our home is just a rusted processed heap of mans scrap. \.it bares no resemblance to the stories I hear of warm grass beneath the feet, and a breeze kissing your cheek.
I want to feel these things, \.Tomo. \. Just as man and woman once did on their earth. \.You could say the apple has tempted me.
If eve ate the apple, \.and that is what got man to this conclusion.... \.what transpires when tempted from the other side of this wall?
Oh, \.hello again Tomo!
