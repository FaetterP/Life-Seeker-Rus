You're the lil jumpy girl! \.whats got you so peppy aye?
Don't ya feel it? \.there's something in the air..... \.like a great crescendo about to grace our ears. 
Boy am I excited for the conflict. 
.......
Don't worry, \.It doesn't involve you. Nor I for that matter! \.I just want to watch!
Come with me!
yes | no
Have you noticed? \. the lost and confused are so much more rare these days.
I used to enjoy telling them subtle mischievous lies.... much harder to deceive new folks these days. 
People see a cute face and don't really ask questions!
That must be how that muse of tragedy tricked that guy! 
Oh how I wish I had her job.... to blow tragic kisses onto man that well into catastrophe
she didn't like that job. | ......
What the hell would you know! \.jump off a tall cliff you uppity bitch!
I know everything about her, \.In fact I plan to replace her once she's gone!
You hangout with ONE muse and think you know it all huh?
Hymnia?
Yeah her! She's quite lovely isn't she.... \.so sweet. 
Ugh I can't stand her.
