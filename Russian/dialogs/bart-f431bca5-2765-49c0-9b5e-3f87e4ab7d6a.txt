Oh... you are the nimble one I see running about. \.I wish I could be so nimble.
A word of advice for you, \. going back the way you came may not lead to where you think it should.

 When we think of numbers we think of vast seas of zeros, \.dreaming to swim in this pool of excess. 
Excess what?\. have you wondered that?\. Watermelon?\. apples?\. meats or money?\.dried cheese?
What about those who think of small numbers.\. 3 the magic number,\ .a tripod, \ .a man a woman and a baby,\. the heart the brain and the body, \. a triangle.
 The beginnning middle and end.\. Our lives have 3 stages, \.This beggining middle and end.
And yet I only wish to stop before the end.\. where are the zeros to saturate this existence?
would they do anything? \. 27 seems like a great place to stop counting.\. Though I read many just drop silent between 50 and 60.

Oh it's you! Will you join me on a stroll?
Sure | Not now

This was one of the earliest streets to appear in our processed world, \.though these days it just so happens to be far warmer.
The sun never had shown itself here, at least not until a few years ago.
There exist many circles of the naraka though it proves difficult to travel between them,\. especially now.
The memories that held them together grow far more fragmented. \. While rare,\. They are still able to be visited.
recently out of the naraka emerged a woman known as the Shekhinah to some.
In her plight she brought forth a tree of life  that served as a sign that the Kabbalah still has some power over the conduct of man. 
Togther her and her golem brought forth a great tower,\. an exit for those who wish to destroy their ego.
Ever since then our city has expanded, yet the memories of those who were here grow distant.

Oh... hello
It's nice here, \.I hope. \.I like to come here to think....
Do you wish you could remember your past life?
I've always thought to myself that you may flay the flesh, but you cannot touch the soul.
Though this side of the world holds many challenges for all souls alike.
I saw miracles, and I bore witness to many wonderful things in both realms.
I can only hope we all find what we seek, no matter how simple.
Hymnia told me that you both seek a flower. \.It's sweet beautiful goal,I promise to keep my eyes peeled for you.
Though I do hope you realize the significance of this yellow asphodel.
I should probably get going, \.I think I will talk with my friend today.
Don't worry, \.he loves you as well.
