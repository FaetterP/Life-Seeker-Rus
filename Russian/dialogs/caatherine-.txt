I hear the last cup of coffee is gone. \.now how can this be? \.surely it can't be so!
I suppose I will be perpetually tired now. \.this simply can't be.
You are telling me it can be? \.No, \.it simply can't.
In fact I've a plan! \.oh yes, \.I had met a vampire who I think can solve my crisis. \.the world is not ready for my evolution.

The vampire refuses to help me. \.Oh, \.this simply can't be.
How will I ever get over being oh so sleepy? \.The kind of tired that sleep can't fix? \.Oh this can't be!
In my infinite naiviety I just sort of assumed she would be willing to feed on me. \.That's how you become a vampire, \.right?
Apparently my blood is too fatty and not the correct type. \.That bitch! \.oh this simply can't be!
are you a vampire perchance? \. you are rather pale.
Yes | no
Is that so? \.show me your teeth then!
You are a liar!
Oh this simply can't be.....
