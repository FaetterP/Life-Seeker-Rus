Oh dear.....\. have you seen my friend?\. she looks kind of serious and has a bandage on her head.
After I lost my job as being a disruptive nuisance to those building the tower she had helped me find new work.
I don't even remember why I was doing that....\. then again I was quite ill back then.
Ill with what? | You feel better now?
Oh dear, \. it's nothing.\. I just tend to be a bit sickly.... 
These days I am able to be much more clear headed.\. It's a rather nice change of pace.
I wish to show you something if you don't mind...
Let's go | not now
With everyone making their way to the tower,\. it's become rather hard to sell the realestate here.
I don't suppose I can interest in a new home here deep within the city?
No thanks. | I already have a home.
but look how modern it is here!\. Not enticing? \. ........
............
Oh dear.... \.I think I'm feeling quite ill again. Don't worry, \.this is normal and will pass.
